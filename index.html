                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Amaltas is widely known for its medicinal and therapeutic properties in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine. Its leaves, bark, fruit pulp, and roots are rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial compounds. Traditionally, the pulp of its fruit has been used as a natural laxative, helping in relieving constipation and detoxifying the digestive system. The plant also supports skin health, where its paste can be applied to treat ringworm and other skin infections. Amaltas is additionally praised for its ability to lower blood sugar levels, manage fevers, and reduce swelling, making it a valuable resource in natural medicine.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> The Amaltas plant flourishes best in the late spring to early summer months, typically between April and June, when it is adorned with brilliant golden-yellow flowers that hang in cascading clusters. These blooms are most striking during peak summer, making the plant a celebrated symbol of summer in South Asia. During the autumn months, the Amaltas produces long, cylindrical seed pods that mature and release seeds, ensuring the plant's propagation. Its seasonal bloom aligns with warm and dry conditions, which support its growth cycle and vibrant flowering.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to South Asia, Amaltas is found across the Indian subcontinent, extending to regions in Southeast Asia like Thailand, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils and ample sunlight, which is why itâ€™s also cultivated in parts of Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean. In India, it is especially revered and often found along roadsides, in gardens, and as an ornamental tree in urban landscapes. Due to its cultural significance and hardy nature, Amaltas has been successfully introduced to warm climates across the world.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Amaltas tree has a moderate growth rate and can live for several decades, often reaching an age of 40 to 50 years under suitable conditions. It generally begins flowering at around 4 to 5 years of age, although this can vary depending on environmental conditions and care. Over time, the tree can grow up to 10-20 meters in height, with a strong, broad trunk and a wide canopy. Its resilience and longevity make it a cherished choice for both ornamental planting and long-term landscaping projects.</p>
